This is the GitHub repository containing the 3D models and source code for the LEET Arpeggiator: https://vonkonow.com/wordpress/leet-arpeggiator/


Description: 

The LEET Arpeggiator is a proof of concept of a miniature MIDI arpeggiator using the same hardware as LEET Control. It is low cost, easy to build and compact in size.

This project is an experiment to see how an arpeggiator could be implemented using the control hardware. 
It is a proof of concept where I have merged [Dmirys arpeggiator1 project](https://github.com/raszhivin/arpeggiator) with the [control surface library](https://github.com/tttapa/Control-Surface) and adjusted it to the control hardware. 
There is no selection of octaves or midi channel and the four note keys are not in orderâ€¦ 


The [parent project (LEET Synthesizer)](https://vonkonow.com/wordpress/leet-synthesizer/) also contains; a drum pad, chord keyboard, arpeggiator and a step sequencer, all with RGB LEDs for playback visualization.
They are easy to build and anyone with a 3D printer and basic soldering skills should be able to replicate them. Everything is open source and hacking is encouraged!
