The parent project (LEET Synthesizer) also contains; a keyboard, drum pad, chord keyboard, control unit and arpeggiator, all with RGB LEDs for playback visualization. They are easy to build and anyone with a 3D printer and basic soldering skills should be able to replicate them. Everything is open source and hacking is encouraged!
