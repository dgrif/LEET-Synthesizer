# This folder contains the 3D models for LEET accessories, like stands, knobs, nametag and clip.

## Stands and clip:
The stands and clip are used to group LEET devices in 3D. They are 0.2mm smaller than the units in order to tightly secure them. It is rather important that your 3D printer has a correct flow (too much and the fit will be too tight, too low and the fit will be too loose).
The clip_dual is used to hold two units in place for transportation (positioned back to back if they have a protruding knob).
It is preferred to print the stands and clip in PET as it has good impact resistance (but PLA will also work). Always print two of each.

## Knobs:
I have used two different potentiometers in the LEET project (hence the two different knobs). 
*	High-end potentiometer with short shaft (called RK09K, RK09D, RV09 or PTV09A etc.)
*	Compact and low cost trimpot.

If you have any preference – let me know in the forum.

## Nametag:
The nametag is a snap on accessory that just contains a sticker in order to identify the units. For example “Lead, ch2” or “Drums, ch7”. Please note that the nametag is held in place with neodymium magnets (10x3x2mm), these are otherwise optional.

## LEET Synthesizer:
The parent project contains; a keyboard, drum pad, chord keyboard, arpeggiator and a step sequencer, all with RGB LEDs for playback visualization.
They are easy to build and anyone with a 3D printer and basic soldering skills should be able to replicate them. Everything is open source and hacking is encouraged!
